# CS 7641 Machine Learning
## Assignment 2
Running the experiments to reproduce the results shown on the report is very easy.   
First, you need to go to the GitHub repository that contains the experiments. It can 
be found on the folowing link: https://github.com/Ithanvelreq/CS7641-ML/tree/master/Assignment2-Randomized-Optimization  
I will be using this same repository for all the course's assignments.
### Format
I used Jupyter Notebooks to run the experiments, this way it is not necessary to execute 
the code in order to see the results. However, if you want to execute the code, you just have to run one cell after the 
other.
### Datasets
The breast cancer dataset is available directly on the scikit learn package.  
The wine dataset was downloaded from the UCI website. I added it to the project's repository for convenience. 
You have nothing to do.
### Requirements
All the requirements needed to run the program are on the requirements.txt file. You can do so by simply running
```shell
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```
